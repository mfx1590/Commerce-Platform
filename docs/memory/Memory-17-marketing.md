# Memory 17 — Marketing
Window: 17 · Key: `marketing` · Branch prefix: `marketing/` · Model: Fable (manager decision 2026-09-08: money and attribution)
Last updated: 2026-09-08 · Contracts: contracts-v0.3 (Store API 0.3.0, Admin API 0.3.0, events 0.2.0, db 0.2.0; tagged at the end of Integration 1) · Branch: `marketing/phase2` · Status: not started (Phase 2)

## Identity (does not change)
Owned paths (write):
- `apps/core/src/modules/marketing/**`
- `apps/feeds/**`
- `apps/admin/src/app/(store)/[storeId]/marketing/**`
- `apps/admin/src/app/(hq)/marketing/**`
Reads:
- docs/marketing-scope.md (the scope and decisions)
- packages/contracts (Admin API marketing paths, v0.3)
- packages/events (campaign.*, feed.published, attribution.recorded, referral.converted, review.published, cart.abandoned)
- apps/core/src/modules/{registry,catalog}/index.ts (public APIs only), promotions module public API (window 9)
Never touches:
- packages/*, docs/ (except this file), other modules' internals, messaging delivery (window 16), CMS (window 6)

## Mission — Phase 2 (Commerce complete, brand 1 live)
Make marketing a product, not a side effect: campaigns with server-side attribution, product feeds for Google Merchant and Meta per brand, segments with a rule builder synced to the messaging provider, abandoned-cart recovery, and the Marketing section of the admin (Store view). Every number reported comes from events and orders in the core, never from a pixel. Wave B — starts when core 2.1–2.2 have merged; marketing may start against the mocks as soon as contracts-v0.3 is tagged.

## Done
- (nothing yet)

## In progress
- (nothing — Phase 2 starts with the first item under Next)

## Next — Phase 2 (GitHub issues; acceptance criteria there are authoritative)
- [ ] **#145 · 2.1** Campaign module with attribution report
- [ ] **#146 · 2.2** Product feeds for Google Merchant and Meta
- [ ] **#147 · 2.3** Segments with preview, materialisation and Klaviyo sync contract
- [ ] **#148 · 2.4** Abandoned-cart recovery
- [ ] **#149 · 2.5** Admin Marketing section v1
- [ ] **#150 · 2.6** READMEs, CLAUDE.md, tests green, Phase 3 handoff

## Decisions made (with reasons)
- 2026-09-05 (manager) · Campaigns/feeds/reviews/referrals are store-level; segment templates and the dashboard are organization-level — same tenancy model as the core.
- 2026-09-05 (manager) · Attribution is server-side from UTM/referrer captured on the cart (window 3 does the capture in Phase 1); pixels are optional extras, never the source of reported numbers.
- 2026-09-05 (manager) · Marketing never mutates orders, prices or stock; it reads events and writes its own tables.

## Blocked / waiting
- (none — contracts-v0.3 delivers the tables, events and Admin API marketing paths)

## Gotchas learned
- Integration 1 (2026-09-08): real Keycloak staff tokens are the default on the core's Admin API; `CORE_DEV_TOKENS=1` keeps `Bearer dev:<subject>` working locally. The storefront can run against the core with `STORE_API_URL=http://localhost:9000` (+ `CORE_STORE_API_FALLBACK=1` + `CORE_STORE_API_FALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:4010` on the core so unimplemented Store routes still answer from Prism). The admin uses `ADMIN_API_URL`.

## Later phases (do not start until Memory-main says so)
### Phase 3 — Multi-store & HQ
- [ ] Referral programme (codes, landing `/r/{code}` with window 3, rewards via promotions, `referral.converted`)
- [ ] Reviews: submission after `shipment.delivered` (request e-mail via window 16), moderation queue, PDP display contract with window 3
- [ ] Consent centre: per-channel opt-in rates, double opt-in for EU brands, export for audits
- [ ] HQ marketing dashboard: per-brand comparison, shared segment templates, budgets per legal entity (feeds window 15 a spend line)
### Phase 5 — Data platform & AI
- [ ] Loyalty (Talon.One or in-house) on top of segments + referral
- [ ] Marketing marts with window 12: campaign ROI, cohort LTV, channel mix
- [ ] AI: product copy for feeds and campaigns, segment suggestions (Claude API)
