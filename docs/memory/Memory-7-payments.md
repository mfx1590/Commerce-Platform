## Gotchas learned
- Integration 1 (2026-09-08): real Keycloak staff tokens are the default on the core's Admin API; `CORE_DEV_TOKENS=1` keeps `Bearer dev:<subject>` working locally. The storefront can run against the core with `STORE_API_URL=http://localhost:9000` (+ `CORE_STORE_API_FALLBACK=1` + `CORE_STORE_API_FALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:4010` on the core so unimplemented Store routes still answer from Prism). The admin uses `ADMIN_API_URL`.
