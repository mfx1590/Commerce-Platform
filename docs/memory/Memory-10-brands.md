# Memory 10 — Brand storefronts (A, B, C…)
Window: 10 · Key: `brands` · Branch prefix: `brands/` · Model: Sonnet
Last updated: 2026-09-08 · Contracts: contracts-v0.3 (Store API 0.3.0, Admin API 0.3.0, events 0.2.0, db 0.2.0; tagged at the end of Integration 1) · Branch: `brands/phase2` · Status: not started (Phase 2)

## Identity (does not change)
Owned paths (write):
- `apps/storefronts/<brand>/**`
- `cms/<brand>/**`
Reads:
- packages/ui
- apps/storefront-starter (read only)
Never touches:
- the starter
- other brands

## Mission — Phase 2 (Commerce complete, brand 1 live)
Brand A real storefront from the starter: theme/layout from Figma, real CMS content, checkout polish, SEO, i18n, full Playwright e2e browse → buy → account. Wave C — starts when cms 2.2 and core 2.2 have merged.

## Gotchas learned
- Integration 1 (2026-09-08): real Keycloak staff tokens are the default on the core's Admin API; `CORE_DEV_TOKENS=1` keeps `Bearer dev:<subject>` working locally. The storefront can run against the core with `STORE_API_URL=http://localhost:9000` (+ `CORE_STORE_API_FALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:4010` on the core so unimplemented Store routes still answer from Prism). The admin uses `ADMIN_API_URL`.
