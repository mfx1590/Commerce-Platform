## Mission — Phase 2 (Commerce complete, brand 1 live)
Brand A real storefront from the starter: theme/layout from Figma, real CMS content, checkout polish, SEO, i18n, full Playwright e2e browse → buy → account. Wave C — starts when cms 2.2 and core 2.2 have merged.

## Done
- **#140 · 2.2 Brand A theme** — DESIGN.md authored first (no Figma), then implemented to it.
  Five measured colours, Newsreader + Hanken Grotesk self-hosted via `next/font/local` from
  `src/brand/fonts/`, radius 2px, shadows none, `brandConfig` = Fieldnote. 21 new tests in
  `test/brand-theme.test.ts` recompute every published contrast ratio. Measured on a production
  build: perf 0.99/0.97, **a11y 1.00**, SEO 0.92, CLS 0.0000/0.0001; bundle budget green ×7.
  REQUEST #278 + #283 filed. Root gate green (lint, format, typecheck 21/21, 332 tests, ownership
  OK). PR #280, 13/13 CI green — but the perf check among them is vacuous (#283).
- **Re-sync brand-a from the starter** — commit e44d87d (prerequisite for 2.2). 148 copied,
  10 preserved, 4 excluded; brought in storefront 2.2-2.4 (SEO/JSON-LD/sitemap/robots, CSP, perf +
  bundle budgets, (content) campaign/legal, Cloudinary) and **#254's `src/brand/config.ts`**.
  Verified: typecheck clean, 312/312 unit tests green.
- **#139 · 2.1 Clone the starter into apps/storefronts/brand-a** — commit 59d4830. Clone via `apps/storefronts/brand-a/scripts/sync-from-starter.mjs` (110 starter files; excludes Dockerfile/README/CHANGELOG/CLAUDE.md; preserves identity files + `src/brand/**` on re-sync, `pnpm --filter @platform/storefront-brand-a sync`). Identity: port 3101, `SITE_URL`/`STORE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (`pk_brand-a_dev_00000000000000000000`) as `??=` runtime defaults in next.config.mjs, path-depth fixes in tsconfig/tailwind/playwright. Verified: build green, `/health` 200, PLP/PDP/de-DE 200 against the mock, 184 unit tests, root lint+typecheck+format green, `diff -rq` vs starter = exactly the README's documented list. REQUEST #197 filed to window 5 (Dockerfile + image manifest; the `check-image-manifests.sh` CI failure on this PR is the intended prompt).

## In progress
- **2.3 (#141) CMS content for brand A — plan written, awaiting the manager's confirmation.**

  Order of commits (one PR):
  1. **Re-sync from the starter** (queued from 2.2): `referral.ts`, `reviews.ts`, `safe-path.ts` + tests.
  2. **`sync-from-starter.mjs` MERGE mode for `package.json`** (manager-approved): identity fields
     (`name`, `version`, `dev` port, `sync`) survive; `scripts` + `dependencies` track the starter.
     One test proving a starter script addition arrives AND name/port survive a re-sync.
  3. **`cms/brand-a/` content** — my owned path; does not exist yet. Typed against `@platform/cms`
     (`PageDocument` etc.), validated with its `validateDocument`. Per locale **en-GB + de-DE**:
     home page, navigation, footer, 4 legal (imprint/privacy/terms/returns), 1 campaign landing
     = ~8 docs × 2 locales.
  4. **Seed runner in `cms/brand-a/`** reusing window 6's *pure* exported helpers (`readSeedEnv`,
     `mutateUrl`, `missingCredentials`) — window 6's `scripts/seed.mjs` only knows its own generic
     fixtures, and it is not my file. No duplicated logic, no edit outside my paths.
  5. **Content snapshot test** — renders the real `(content)` route components against the real
     brand-A documents through the injectable `CmsReader`, asserting no empty-state fallback text
     appears. This is how the acceptance criterion is met offline (no Sanity credentials needed).
  6. README + CHANGELOG + memory.

  Content voice follows `src/brand/DESIGN.md` — copy is design, not filler.

  **Flagged to the manager, not decided by me:** the statutory fields of a German *Impressum*
  (registration court, HRB number, VAT ID, responsible person) are legally binding. I will write
  structurally correct documents with those fields as clearly-marked placeholders and will NOT
  invent registration numbers or compliance claims. Real legal review before production.

## Next — Phase 2 (GitHub issues; acceptance criteria there are authoritative)
- [x] **#139 · 2.1** Clone the starter into apps/storefronts/brand-a (in PR)
- [ ] **#140 · 2.2** Theme and layout overrides from the brand design
- [ ] **#141 · 2.3** CMS content for brand A
- [ ] **#142 · 2.4** SEO and i18n for brand A
- [ ] **#143 · 2.5** End-to-end suite browse → buy → account for brand A
- [ ] **#144 · 2.6** Launch checklist for brand A

## Decisions made (with reasons)
- **Brand A is designed here, not in Figma** (2.2): no Figma exists. `src/brand/DESIGN.md` is
  written before the code and the code is held to it. Calm editorial D2C apparel; five named values
  (Paper #F7F4EF, Ink #23201B, Clay #9C4A32, Sage #5F6B57, Stone #746C60), all pairs measured
  against WCAG (Stone was darkened from #7A7266 after it measured 4.32:1). Newsreader + Hanken
  Grotesk, self-hosted. Explicitly not the admin's dark Medusa rail and not the AI-default look
  (no purple gradients, glassmorphism, floating cards, stock hero).
- **Fonts are wired through `tokens.ts`, not through a component slot** (2.2): the only
  always-present slots are `Header`/`Footer`, and the checkout and account layouts render neither —
  a font injected from a slot would drop out at checkout. `tokens.ts` is imported by the root
  `[locale]/layout.tsx`, so the CSS `next/font` emits for it is linked from `<head>` on every route.
- **Brand identity lives in `next.config.mjs` runtime defaults (`??=`), not src edits** (2.1): `next build/dev/start` all load the config before app code, the environment still wins, and `src/**` stays byte-identical to the starter (except `src/brand/**`) so `sync-from-starter.mjs` re-syncs produce reviewable diffs. `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID` needed no override — the starter already defaults to `storefront-brand-a`.
- **The sync script is self-hosting and lives in the brand app** (`scripts/sync-from-starter.mjs`): the starter stays untouched (window 3's path), and Phase 3's "scripted re-sync" (ADR 0004) exists from day one — preserve list = the README's documented diff table.
- **No Dockerfile in the brand app**: `**/Dockerfile` is window 5's ownership row, so the clone excludes it; REQUEST #197 asks for the image.

## Blocked / waiting
- **2.2 push held** until the manager confirms no queue is running.
- **REQUEST #278** (window 3): the starter's `test/slots.test.ts` asserts the brand's own override
  files are empty — false by construction in a clone. Until it lands, that file deviates and is on
  the clone's PRESERVE list; drop it and re-sync afterwards.
- CI brand-storefront journeys stay opt-in (`E2E_INCLUDE_BRAND_STOREFRONTS=1`) until window 2
  lands #212; brands opts in at 2.5 (#143) after that.

## Gotchas learned
- **The CI perf gate never runs for brand storefronts — it reports a vacuous pass in ~4 s.**
  `infra/ci/changes.sh:98` matches `apps/storefront-starter/`, not `apps/storefronts/`; and even
  when it fires, `ci.yml:229` runs `--filter @platform/storefront-starter perf`, so a brand's own
  `bundle-budget.json` / `lighthouserc.json` (:3101) are never read. REQUEST #283. **Until it
  lands, measure by hand at every brands task and quote the numbers in the PR** — do not read that
  green check as evidence. Verify a classifier claim by running it:
  `CHANGED_FILES="<paths>" bash infra/ci/changes.sh`.
- **`next/font/local` is a build-time transform with no runtime implementation.** Any vitest test
  that reaches `tokens.ts` must `vi.mock('next/font/local')`, and the import of the module under
  test has to be a dynamic `await import` so the mock is in place first.
- **`next/font` emits `<link rel="preload">` only when a `className`/`variable` is rendered.**
  Reading `.style.fontFamily` gets the @font-face CSS (in the root layout's chunk, so on every
  route) but no preload. Measured cost: CLS 0.0000 — the size-adjusted fallback absorbs the swap.
- **SEO scores ~0.58 locally until `ROBOTS_ALLOW_INDEXING=1`** — `/robots.txt` fails closed and
  returns `Disallow: /`. With it set: 0.92. Not a defect; do not chase it as one.
- **The PRESERVE list silently withholds new starter scripts**: `package.json` never takes them, so
  brand-a had missed `perf` and `bundle-budget` entirely. Diff the two package.json files after
  every sync.
- Newsreader's optical-size axis doubles the file (132 kB vs 58 kB weight-only). Check a variable
  font's axes before vendoring it.
- The clone drifts behind the starter fast (53 commits by 2.2). **Re-sync before any brand work**,
  commit the re-sync on its own, then build the brand change on top — a mixed commit is unreviewable.
- `Announcement` renders *inside* the default `Header` (`src/layouts/defaults.tsx`), not at the root,
  so it is not a document-wide injection point.
- The clone sits one directory deeper than the starter: `tsconfig.json` `extends`, `tailwind.config.ts` ui-dist glob and `playwright.config.ts` webServer `cwd` each need one more `../` — a byte-identical copy fails `next build` with TS5083 on `tsconfig.base.json`.
- Backgrounded `&` children of a Bash call can outlive the call (a stray Prism held :4010 and made the next `pnpm mock` die with EADDRINUSE while probes returned 401 = actually up). Check the port before assuming the mock is down.
- Integration 1 (2026-09-08): real Keycloak staff tokens are the default on the core's Admin API; `CORE_DEV_TOKENS=1` keeps `Bearer dev:<subject>` working locally. The storefront can run against the core with `STORE_API_URL=http://localhost:9000` (+ `CORE_STORE_API_FALLBACK=1` + `CORE_STORE_API_FALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:4010` on the core so unimplemented Store routes still answer from Prism). The admin uses `ADMIN_API_URL`.

## How to run & test this package
- `pnpm --filter "@platform/storefront-brand-a^..." build` once per fresh worktree (ui/cms/contracts dists), then `pnpm --filter @platform/storefront-brand-a build|start|dev|test|typecheck|e2e`. Mock: `pnpm mock` (:4010). App on :3101; `/health`. Against the core: `STORE_API_URL=http://localhost:9000` (core with `CORE_STORE_API_FALLBACK=1` + `CORE_STORE_API_FALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:4010`).
- Re-sync after merging main: `pnpm --filter @platform/storefront-brand-a sync`, review the git diff.

## Later phases (do not start until Memory-main says so)
