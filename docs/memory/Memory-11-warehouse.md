Never touches:
- inventory internals

## Mission — Phase 3 (Multi-store & HQ)
Multi-brand allocation rules over shared stock locations, Odoo Inventory (or WMS) integration, scanner pick/pack flows, cycle counts.

## Done
- (nothing yet)

## In progress
- **#435 (task 3.1) — BUILT locally, not pushed, no PR yet.** Local commits on warehouse/phase3: dc182e8 (design + proposed copies + RLS test), d582af1 (revision 2 after the #453 decision: R1–R4), then the engine commit (this one). Contents: design README, `proposed/` (0190, 0191, stock.moved v2, stock_item.mapped v1, Admin API fragment), `allocation.ts` + `types.ts` + `index.ts`, tests: `allocation.test.ts` 24, `proposed-migrations.test.ts` 34, `shared-pool.test.ts` 8 (local fake of the #454 seam inside the test file).
- **Next (in this order):** (1) DONE: full local gate run, see Gotchas for the 4 foreign failures; (2) report to the manager and WAIT for the word to push (hold every push; merge main first); (3) when 0190 is on main: merge main, delete `proposed/0190_stock_pool.sql`, make `testing/pool-database.ts` apply only 0191; (4) open the PR for #435 (names contracts version, links #435; no closing keyword next to #453 / #454), then record "PR #N (code commit <sha>; head = this memory commit)" and message the manager — again when every check has finished; (5) after window 1's rekey + seam land: types.ts becomes re-exports of the inventory module's, the fake in shared-pool.test.ts is replaced by the real `reserveForOrder`, one line in src/wiring.ts is window 1's (REQUEST #454 names it).
- **Engine decisions (mine, in the README):** warehouses ranked once per order by fulfillment's routing rules (imported through its public API: `routingSettingsFrom`, `regionOf`); a line goes WHOLE to the first ranked warehouse that can cover it (one shipment from farther beats a nearer split), else greedy split; rule per allocation, `split:<rule>` for the second and later warehouse; what an earlier line took from a stock item is gone for the next line; shortfall is reported, never decided (the inventory module answers 409 or backorders). No fast-check in the repo and apps/core/package.json is not mine: the property test uses a seeded generator (500 cases).

## Next — Phase 3
- [ ] Allocation policy engine
- [ ] WMS adapter (Odoo Inventory)
- [ ] Scanner flows
- [ ] Cycle counts + reconciliation

## Decisions made (with reasons)
- **Manager rulings 2026-10-12 (plan confirmed):**
  - D1 = expand then rekey, TWO migrations in one issue. 0190 (landable alone): `stock_item`, nullable `product_variant.stock_item_id`, the backfill, nothing else. 0191 (lands ONLY with window 1's inventory rewrite): backfill again, NOT NULL, `inventory_level` keyed (stock_item_id, warehouse_id) with store_id dropped, `reservation` gains stock_item_id and keeps store_id, `stock_movement` gains stock_item_id with store_id nullable. Admin API additions land with 0191, not before.
  - D2 = 1:1 backfill, never an automatic merge; item sku = the variant's when unique in the organization, else `<store code>:<sku>`. `mapVariantToStockItem`: `operations` on `organization:hq`; 409 unless the variant's current item has zero on-hand and no open reservation at every warehouse; audit row; idempotent.
  - D3 = `stock.moved` v2 with 0191 (required stock_item_id + the item's sku; optional variant/store attribution); v1 stays what the core emits until the rekey. Envelope needs no diff (store_id already nullable; outbox is `store_nullable`).
  - RLS: plain `organization` kind REFUSED for the pool. Store scope reaches a pool row only when one of its stores maps the item; reservation stays `store` kind.
  - The manager files window 1's rekey task after deciding #453 and bundles #454 into it.
- **#453 decision (2026-10-12), required changes, all done in revision 2:** R1 + R2 = `guard_variant_stock_item` in 0190 (INSERT and UPDATE OF stock_item_id; only organization scope maps; fail-closed, an empty scope refused — so the SEED must set app.scope = 'organization' to map the shared item); R3 = third RLS kind `pool_ledger` for stock_movement (a store session reads/writes only movements attributed to its own stores; store-less and other stores' movements are organization scope only); R4 = the SECURITY DEFINER trigger takes its scope from the function-level `SET app.scope = 'organization'` clause (Postgres accepts a custom parameter there), EXECUTE revoked. Additions: `stock_item.mapped` v1 event written by `mapVariantToStockItem` (envelope enums gain the topic + aggregate type `stock_item`); `InventoryLevel.id` is the pool row's and can repeat (key by variant_id + warehouse_id); the sku-existence property is recorded in the README. Not a DB constraint: `reservation.stock_item_id` = the variant's item at reserving time — window 1's module enforces it.
- **Accepted as I wrote them (points on #453):** kinds `pool_self` / `pool`; new-variant insert trigger; `inventory_level.variant_id` dropped with store_id; `reservation.allocation_rule`; stock_movement store_id + variant_id nullable together (CHECK); v2 payload carries store_id next to variant_id; `InventoryLevel` per (variant, warehouse) + required `stock_item_id`; `createStockMovement` unchanged.

## Blocked / waiting
- #453: decided; waiting for the manager to LAND 0190 (db 0.3.4), then 0191 + events + Admin API with window 1's inventory rewrite.
- #454 (REQUEST: `setAllocationPolicy` in the inventory module) — window 1, bundled into its rekey task; local fake meanwhile.

## Gotchas learned
- Local gate 2026-10-12 on aef9f51: lint, format:check, typecheck green; core tests 959 passed, 4 FAILED, all in window 2's live suites (hq-rbac roles.test.ts x3, scope.test.ts x1: `expected 503 to be 201` on a role assign) in this worktree with a fresh .env copy while OpenFGA and Keycloak answer 200. Not ours (nothing in hq-warehouse is imported there); reported to the manager, stack untouched. Every hq-warehouse test (66) passed in that run.
- The seed has NO orders: a test reservation needs a bare `cart` row (organization, store, sales_channel, currency, locale, country).
- The seed's skus carry the store code, so no two brands share one; to test the collision rule a variant must be inserted BEFORE 0190 is applied (`createPoolDatabase('seeded')`, then `applyProposed`).
- With `pool_ledger`, a store-scoped session cannot write a store-less movement: the local fake of the seam and any test fixture must attribute a store's movement to that store (store_id + variant_id together) or write it in organization scope.
- Trigger order is by NAME: `guard_variant_stock_item` must sort before `variant_stock_item` so the guard sees the value the session sent, not the one the trigger filled in.
- A policy column cannot be dropped: 0191 drops `tenant_isolation` on inventory_level / stock_movement first and re-applies the `pool` kind after.
- `apps/core/test/guards.test.ts` fails on `UPDATE inventory_level` / `INSERT INTO stock_movement` outside the inventory module in NON-test files: the local fake of the seam must live in a `*.test.ts` file or under a path the guard skips — check before writing it.
- Long shell heredocs with backticks or quotes break the Bash tool here: write scripts and test files with the Write tool, run them by path.
- The catalog read model (window 1) sums `inventory_level.available` per variant (`catalog/service.ts:165`); after 0191 it must join through the stock item — window 1's change.

## How to run & test this package
- Setup (done 2026-10-12): `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`; `pnpm -r --filter './packages/*' build`; `cp .env.example .env`. Never `pnpm dev` / docker here: the stack is shared.
- One file, outside turbo (~15 s): export DATABASE_URL and DATABASE_URL_APP with the two values from .env.example (127.0.0.1:5433), then `pnpm --filter @platform/core exec vitest run src/modules/hq-warehouse`.
- Gate: `pnpm lint && pnpm format:check && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test --filter @platform/core`. Live suites: ask the manager for the machine first, say "machine free" after.
