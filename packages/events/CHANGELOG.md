# Changelog — @platform/events

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-04

- Scaffold created by the main window (Phase 0).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-04 (Phase 0 step 5)

- 24 event schemas v1 (JSON Schema 2020-12) + common $defs + envelope; `additionalProperties: false` everywhere; no PII fields.
- `scripts/generate.mjs` → `src/generated/{schemas,types}.ts` (json-schema-to-typescript); committed.
- `createValidator`, `makeEvent`, `toOutboxRow`; `migrations/0100_outbox.sql` (outbox table + RLS, applied by packages/db).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-08 (Integration 1, marketing)

- Seven new v1 topics (31 total): `campaign.launched`, `campaign.ended`, `feed.published`, `attribution.recorded`, `referral.converted`, `review.published`, `cart.abandoned` (docs/marketing-scope.md). Payloads carry ids, enums, minor amounts and hashes only: no review text, `code_hash` instead of the referral code, `email_hash` instead of the email, `referrer` is an origin.
- Decided at Integration 1: attribution is its own event (`attribution.recorded`, one per touch, same transaction as `order.placed`); `order.placed` stays at v1.
- Envelope v1: `topic` and `aggregate_type` enums extended (additive) with the new topics and `campaign`, `feed`, `attribution`, `referral`, `review`, `cart`. Existing envelopes keep validating; an envelope v2 would have forced every consumer to migrate for an enum widening.
