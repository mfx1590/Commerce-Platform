# Changelog — @platform/storefront-starter

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-04

Task [storefront] 1.2 (issue #18), contracts `contracts-v0.1`. Replaces the Phase 0 scaffold with the
real Next.js App Router app.

- Next 15 App Router on port 3100, React 19, Tailwind 3 driven by the `@platform/ui` preset.
- Route groups `(shop)` (`/`, `/products`), `(checkout)` (`/cart`, `/checkout`, own funnel chrome),
  `(account)` (`/account`), `(content)` (`/pages/[slug]`, placeholder for window 6), plus `not-found`.
- Root layout resolves the theme — `store.theme` from the API layered under `src/brand/tokens.ts` —
  and renders `<body>` through `ThemeProvider`.
- Typed Store API client in `src/lib/store-api/`: every operation of the Store API, `X-Publishable-Key`
  on every request, `Idempotency-Key` support, cache tags, `StoreApiError` with the contract's error
  codes, and a path allowlist so a customer token can only reach `/store/customers/*` and
  `/store/orders/{id}`. Server-only.
- Brand override pattern: `src/brand/{tokens.ts,components/,layouts/}` plus slot registries in
  `src/lib/slots.ts`, documented in the README.
- 16 Vitest tests (client URL/header/error/token behaviour, slot resolution).
- Phase 1 renders every route per request; task 1.3 introduces per-route caching.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-04

- Scaffold created by the main window (Phase 0).
